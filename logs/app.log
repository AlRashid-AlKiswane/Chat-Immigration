Issuance of \nadditional sets of clothing to those more frequently required to wear FRC is \ntaken into consideration. \n \nFor those locations that provide FRC for temporary or shared use, Citgo', 'management is responsible to ensure that there is an adequate supply in a variety \nof sizes to accommodate most situations, and that the clothing will be \nmaintained in a clean and serviceable manner. \n \nContract Employees \n \nIt is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that their employees are \nproperly outfitted in FRC and/or arc protective clothing prior to allowing them \nto report to a Citgo FRC Area or Temporary FRC Area. \n \nVisitors', 'Visitors \n \nVisitors to FRC Areas are provided with FRC, if they do not provide their own. \nLong sleeved,  \nFlame-resistant smocks or lab coats extending at least to the knee, are \nconsidered acceptable for limited use by Visitors only (Visitors includes Citgo \noffice employees visiting  \nFRC Areas.) Care should be taken to ensure that smocks are not worn in areas \nwhere entanglement could become a hazard. Clothing worn under the smocks', 'must include long pants which completely cover the legs and appropriate closed \ntoed footwear. The wearing \nOf shorts, skirts, sandals, etc. Shall not be permitted. \n \nManner Worn  \n \nAll FRC must be worn so as to provide the maximum protection for which it \nwas designed. \n \nShirts/coveralls/smocks are fastened up to the bottom of the neck )only top \nbutton unbuttoned). \n \nSleeves remain extended to cover the wrists. However, if approved by local', 'management, cuffs may be rolled back while in Non-FRC Areas or where \nextended sleeves could create a', '8 \n \nMore immediate hazard (working with certain rotating equipment). \n \nLegs are covered the full length. \nThe looser fitting the FRC, the more thermal protection the clothing system will \nprovide. Air is a very effective insulator; therefore, maintaining an air gap \nbetween the clothing and skin will improve thermal protection. However, a loose \nfit must be balanced against the hazard of clothing being caught in moving', 'equipment. Most FRC products will shrink either the same or less than standard \nwork clothing, and should be sized accordingly. \n \n \nFRC should be worn over non-melting fabrics or other flame resistant materials. \nFor example, one recommended combination is wearing a Nomex IIIA coverall \nOver a 100% cotton tee shirt and underwear. Layering garments in this manner \ndramatically increases the thermal protection of the clothing system by adding', '“air gaps” that provide excellent thermal insulation. \n \nFRC, where required, must be the outermost garment worn. Non-Flame \nResistant Clothing is not allowed to be worn over FRC while in an FRC Area. \n \nFRC Maintenance \n \nDamaged FRC \n \nFRC is replaced if it has been torn or otherwise damaged, or has become worn to \nthe point that its fire resistance is questionable. If the damage is repairable, then \nrepairs are made only by authorized individuals in a manner and with materials', 'that will provide protection \nequivalent to the FRC when new. \n \nPatches/Embroidery \n \nOnly patches or embroidery provided or authorized by Citgo are allowed on \nFRC \nworn by Citgo employees. Care must be taken to not add potential fuel sources \nto the FRC which will compromise the ability of the FRC to provide the \nintended \nprotection. For example, embroidery work and patches might or might not be \nproduced from flame retardant materials. \n \nLaundering', '9 \n \nEmployees laundering their own FRC are responsible to ensure that the \nmanufacture’s  \nRecommendations are being followed. Care must be taken to assure that \ndetergents or additives such as fabric softeners will not compromise the flame \nretardant properties of the FRC.

Contextual Information \nAs excerpted from the "OSHA Enforcement Policy for Flame-Resistant Clothing in Oil and Gas \nDrilling, Well Servicing, and Production-Related Operations"; March 19, 2010: \n"While the oil and gas industry has worked to reduce the risk of flash fire \nincidents, these efforts have not eliminated the occurrence of flash fires, nor the \nresulting burn injuries and fatalities. The use of FRC greatly improves the chance', 'of a worker surviving and regaining quality of life after a flash fire. FRC can \nsignificantly reduce both the extent and severity of burn injuries to the body. \nInherent flash fire hazards are associated with oil and gas well drilling, servicing, \nand production-related operations. Additionally, the industry has a history of burn-\nrelated injuries and fatalities due to flash fire hazards when engineering and \nadministrative controls have failed. Therefore, OSHA has concluded that employers', 'are required to provide and ensure the use of FRC during certain operations." \nPage3', 'Appropriate Workwear for Flash \nFire and Explosion Hazards \n \nWhat is the hazard? \n \nFlash fires and explosions are common hazards at a variety of Alberta workplaces. \nThese hazards are present in work areas where flammable materials are handled, \nprocessed, stored, or in any way present. In the petrochemical industry for example, \nflash fire can occur at well head sites, collection points, compressor stations,', 'refineries, and petrochemical and plastic plants. In such areas, the potential exists for \ndeveloping an explosive atmosphere capable of injuring or killing workers and \ncausing extensive property damage. \n \nIndustrial flash fires and explosions result from the accidental release and ignition of \nflammable fuels. The size and duration of the flame that results from this ignition is \ndetermined by the amount of fuel available, the efficiency of combustion, and the', 'environmental and physical characteristics of the site of the flash fire or explosion. \nThe temperatures attained by flash fires have been estimated to range from 550 to \n10500C, although higher temperatures are believed to occur. Even the lowest \nestimated temperature exceeds the temperature at which most regular clothing \nfabrics burst into flames. \n \nWhere the burn happens \n \nA worker can be far enough away from the fuel source that they are unable to smell', 'the fuel yet still be engulfed by the flame and suffer burns. If the flash fire or \nexplosion is sufficiently intense, the heat produced may cause regular clothing to \nmelt or begin burning.  This damage occurs with a burst of flame that rarely lasts \nmore than 6 seconds —usually 3 seconds or less. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\xa0\nPPE005 — Personal Protective Equipment \nRevised April 2006 – Reformatted September 2010', 'PPE005 — Personal Protective Equipment \nRevised April 2006 – Reformatted September 2010 \n \nContrary to popular belief, workers not wearing fire retardant clothing who have \nsurvived flash fires and explosions do not suffer the most serious burns on their \nuncovered head and hands. Instead, the areas that are covered by their regular \nclothing are the most severely burned. The burning clothing, in contact with the skin', 'and burning long after the flame has retreated, causes the most severe burns.  \nClothing that melts without burning can also cause significant damage. \n \nFire retardant clothing \n \nProtection against burns due to flash fires can be provided by lightweight clothing \nmade of materials that look, feel, and wear like regular work clothes. Worn as the \noutermost layer, such protective clothing reduces the severity of burn injuries and', 'increases the likelihood of survival in the event of a flash fire or explosion. This \nspecialized fire resistant or fire retardant (FR) clothing is intended to protect workers \nfrom exposure to intense heat and flame for short periods of time. An altogether \ndifferent type of protective clothing is required for situations where exposure to \nintense heat is frequent, normal, and of extended duration. \n \nFR clothing is unique because when exposed to high heat and flame for short periods', 'of time, it does not burn, it does not melt, and it shields the clothing worn beneath it \nfrom the intense heat of the flame.  FR fabrics are either inherently flame resistant — \nthe fibres are of a material that itself does not burn — or are made of materials that \nundergo some type of treatment so that they are made non-flammable. Wool and \nleather are two naturally flame resistant materials that are appropriate in some work', 'situations. While natural wool is not entirely non-flammable, it is self-extinguishing \nand therefore has some inherent flame resistance. \n \nOther important performance characteristics \n \nFR clothing must be properly selected for the tasks performed, the hazards associated \nwith these tasks, and the work environment in which the tasks are performed i.e. hot, \ncold, clean, dirty. \n \nThe final selection of FR clothing is often based on properties or characteristics other', 'than the clothing’s fire resistance. These other factors include \n(1) resistance to chemicals; \n(2) resistance to abrasion; \n(3) ability to resist build-up of static charge; \n(4) ability to act as a barrier to liquids and soils encountered at the workplace;', 'PPE005 — Personal Protective Equipment \nRevised April 2006 – Reformatted September 2010 \n \n(5) worker comfort i.e. fit, feel, warmth, coolness — a particular trade name of fabric \nis often available in a variety of different thicknesses, affecting the clothing’s fit, \nfeel, breathability, and temperature characteristics.  The clothing should cover as \nmuch of the body as possible.  Clothing worn beneath FR clothing should not \nbecome exposed when bending, reaching, or crouching;', '(6) degree of use i.e. continuous, intermittent; and \n(7) frequency of washing and cleaning required to maintain clothing performance. \n \nInappropriate clothing materials \n \nMost of the clothing fabrics traditionally used for outerwear are inappropriate for use \naround flash fire and explosion hazards. Untreated cotton, polyester, nylon, and \npolycotton blends are such examples. Untreated cotton has a very low ignition', 'temperature of approximately 250oC and burns intensely and rapidly. Untreated \npolyesters and nylons ignite easily (250 - 350oC) and melt readily. Nylon is also \nparticularly prone to static build-up and is a recognized ignition source. Polycotton \nblends combine the worst characteristics of both polyester and cotton. \n \nClothing worn beneath FR clothing and against the skin should be made of FR fabrics \nor natural fibres that do not melt. Appropriate natural fibres include wool, silk, and', 'cotton. \n \nMaintaining FR clothing \n \nTo retain the clothing’s original FR characteristics, it should be cleaned as specified \nby the manufacturer. FR clothing loses its effectiveness if the fabric is soiled with dirt \nand oily residues. Cleaning helps to return the clothing to its original condition but \nmust be done as recommended by the manufacturer. The build-up of detergent and \nmineral residues in and on the fabric can compromise the fabric’s effectiveness. One', 'of the most common ways to destroy the special properties of treated FR clothing is \nto use bleach during laundering. \n \nAny tears or other damage must be repaired promptly so that the clothing maintains \nits protective qualities. FR fabric patches and FR thread must be used as repair \nmaterials. Once again, the manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed when \nclothing is repaired.', 'Contact us: \n \nProvince-Wide Contact Centre \n\xa0\n\x0b Edmonton & surrounding \narea: \n780-415-8690 \n\x0b Throughout Alberta: \n1-866-415-8690 \n \n\xa0\n\xa0Deaf or hearing impaired \n\x83 In Edmonton:  780-427-9999 \nor \n\x83 \n1-800-232-7215  \nthroughout Alberta \n\xa0\nWeb Site \n\xa0\n\x1d www.worksafe.alberta.ca\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nGetting copies of OHS Act, Regulation & Code: \n\xa0\n\xa0\nQueen’s Printer \n \n\x1d  www.qp.gov.ab.ca \n \n\x0b\xa0Edmonton  780-427-4952 \n        \n\xa0\n\xa0\nWorkplace\xa0Health\xa0and\xa0Safety\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\x1d http://employment.alberta.ca/whs-ohs', 'Call any Government of Alberta office toll-free \nDial 310-0000, then the area code and telephone number you want to reach \n \n© 2010-2011, Government of Alberta, Employment and Immigration  \n \nThis material may be used, reproduced, stored or transmitted for non-commercial purposes.
